The lights turn off completely.
You: What was that??? Then again, considering it's the MTA, maybe I shouldn't be that surprised. They really need to step up their game. 
The lights are off for about a minute, during which you stay engrossed with an intense game of angry birds. 

The lights turn back on, and you hear a scream.
You stare in shock as your eyes fall on a bloodied body sitting in one of the train seats. 

Train Speaker: Due to complications, we will be taking this train straight to Chambers. 
Train Speaker: The exiting doors will remain locked until then. 
Train Speaker: DO NOT WORRY, EVERYTHING IS UNDER CONTROL.

You turn to look at your fellow travellers and come to 2 conclusions:
1. With the amount of blood the person lost, there was no way they were still alive
2. There was a murderer in train car, with you, at that very moment. 

You: This calls for an investigation! I'll start by asking for names...
<asks for names>

You: ...
You: I could've sworn I heard the doors open and shut twice! Let me go into the other cars...

<left car or right car?> 
(left cars are empty, one or two people that aren't of interest)
<right car -> you see an old lady knitting -> next car over has no people but 
you find a large pair of gloves and a bloody knife>

You: I can't believe my eyes...
In front of you lays a bloody pair of gloves... and a knife...

<door to prev cars is locked>

Ask the old lady a question? 
 - Did you see someone come in to the car a few minutes ago?
 - Oh...well aside from you, dear, I couldn't see much else. The lights went off,
   you know!
 - Not even a shadow? Did you at least hear someone? 
 - I did see a long shadow walk through the door, but I'm afraid I can't tell you much
   else. It's my age, my eyes aren't what they used to be.
 - Ah, I see. Thank you for your help!
 - Of course, dear!

You: The killer escaped pretty swiftly.. This must have been a planned attack...
You: But with the knife and gloves here, it must've been rushed.
You: I doubt the killer would have a strong alibi!

<asks everyone where they're going> 
 - Hamim and Yuki give off sus vibes but aren't tall enough 
 - Anjini is tall enough but isn't sus, just weird
 - Fred is sus and tall 

 <responses to the question: Where are you going?
  - Hamim: We're literally in the same APCS class, I'm going 
           to class like you. 
    protag: Its 7 am, you're ridiculously early.
    Hamim: So are you...
    protag: Fair enough
 - Yuki: I'm headed over to South Street Sea Port to meet with some friends 
   protag: it's 7 am? 
   Yuki: And your point is? 
   protag: ...
 - Anjini: Book shopping! I have a whole route planned out. My goal is to
           visit at least 15 stores.
    protag: Are you a native New Yorker...? This feels like a very touristy thing
            to do. 
    Anjini: It is not! And for your information, yes I am a native New Yorker.
 - Fred: I'm headed to Brooklyn to visit some friends.
    protag: Oh cool! What part? 
    Fred: Williamsburg.
    protag: I don't the 2 goes to Williamsburg.
    Fred: No, no it doesn't. I'm going to switch over to the F train at Chambers Street.
    protag: Right...
---

You feel the train begin to slow. 
You: Oh god, we're nearing Chambers... I have to follow someone out! Or else I'll never catch the killer...

You dash out the train car to see your main four suspects, Hamim, Yuki, Anjini, and Fred.
Hamim approaches the E train platform. Yuki gets on the C. Anjini heads for the 3. Fred i about to ext the station.

Who do you choose to follow?

<fred>
You turn to him just as the doors open. 
He catches your eye before you sprint out of the car to follow him.
You rush up the stars, taking two at a time before taking a deep breath of air when you reach above the 
station. 
You can't see Fred anymore...where could he have gone? 
You jog over to the nearby park, spotting Fred trying to blend in with the crowd. 
You run faster and tackle him off his feet, pulling his arms behind his back just as the police come over to 
see what the commotion is about. 
You explain the sitation and all the evidence you've gathered so far. 
Police Officer: We appreciate the help you've given us, trust me. Just promise us that you won't EVER do that again!
You: Yes sir!
You lied as naturally as you breath.
The police officer nods approvingly at you, and then takes his leave.

You: All in a day's work, hehe. Can't believe I busted a murderer today!
You check the time on your phone. 
You: It's 8:20... AGHHHHHHHHHHHH I'M LATE FOR CS

And thus you conclude your journey by going on with your typical daily routine, forever to be an unspoken hero.4

YOU WIN!

<!fred>
You follow them onto the train.
The rest of your ride is... uneventful...
You finally come to realize... that you lost the murderer...
And whilst your bout of shame, Fred plans his next murder.

YOU LOSE!
