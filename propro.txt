Subway Serial Stalkers: Anjini, Yuki, Hamim
APCS
Final Project - Proposal

For our final project, we plan on making a RPG where our protagonist 
has to solve a subway murder. To do this, we have 3 main classes planned 
out: Train (with subclass TrainCar), MC(main character), and Murder(the 
driver class).

The train class will be comprised of a linked list of TrainCars. This
represents the train that out protagonist will be able to travel through.


Priorities:
 - MC Class -> our protag
 - Make Train class and train car class
 - Driver Class to run the game 
      - what's your name?
      - tunnel/bridge lights flicker (storyline), murder, who done it
      - 


Classes to implement: 
 - Train
    - Letter Train (specified during initialization)
    - Doubled Linked list of Train Cars
    - follows chosen train path 
 - MC
    - has to pick which path to take 
 - Train Car
    - number of passengers -> max capacity 
    - space to sit or no? 
    - boolean locked door function 
    - using scanner we lock the doors of the car in front, behind or 
      current car
 - Train Time (optional -> lower priority)
    - different times mean different schedules 
 - Murder!
   - all the details of the plot and who done it are here 
    
   
Murder Mystery Plot:
 - mc -> very smart bystander >:D
 - go into a tunnel/bridge, lights flicker off, turn on, person dead
   - WHO DONE IT???
 - convenience:  
   - stuck on a bridge for sanity sake 
   - no jumping >:(
 - Timer function?????
