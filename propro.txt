Final Project - Proposal
2022-27-05

For our final project, we plan on making a RPG where our protagonist 
has to solve a subway murder. To do this, we have 3 main classes planned 
out: Train (with subclass TrainCar), Protagonist, and Woo(the 
driver class).

The train class will be comprised of a linked list of TrainCars. This
represents the train that out protagonist will be able to travel through.
Each train car has a certain number of people (not including out protagonist)
and this number will not change. The doors can also lock and open on the protagonist's
asking. The protagonist class allows the player to choose what they want to be called.
They also have to option to take notes as time goes on and they collect new information. 
To get this informtaion, they ask questions to the other characters on the train.
The Woo class is where the main story line will be taking place. It is where we
see the Protagonist interact with other characters and how they collect data. In addition to 
these classes, we hope to implement Proccessing via things like a map of the train.

If given more time, we plan on adding a timer funtion that either times how long the 
person took to solve the mystery, or puts a timelimit as to how long the player
can try to guess who the murderer is without being killed.
