---------------------

Plot:

You're riding on the 2 train, going downtown to Stuyvesant 
High School, when the lights start to flicker. You pay no
mind to it, brushing it off as the usual train shenanigans. 

When the lights turn off completely, you're a little surprised,
but brush it off again, thinking to yourself 'The MTA needs to
step up their game'. The lights are off for about a minute, 
during which you stay engrossed with an intense game of angry 
birds. 

When the lights turn back on, you hear a scream. You turn to 
source of the noise as stare in shock as your eyes fall on a 
bloodied body sitting in one of the train seats. 

You turn to look at your fellow travellers and come to 2 conclusions:
1. With the amount of blood the person lost, there was no way they were still alive
2. There was a murderer in train car, with you, at that very moment.
