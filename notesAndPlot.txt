Notes:
- Things we're using from semester two
    - Linked List for train cars
    - sort for updated sus ratings
    - processing for making things pretty
    - stacks for givign hints
- Scanner functions
    - hint
        - stack for giving hints -> lowest thing in stack
        will be a very telling hint, closer to the top is
        more vague
    - Give up
        - gives the player the answer (answer is predetermined)
    - Guess
        - Player types who they think the killer is (answer will
          not be given, only "right" or "wrong")
